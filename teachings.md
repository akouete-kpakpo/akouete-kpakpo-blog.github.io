Here you can find some teachings with links to exercises (in french) I’ve selected per chapter when I was mathematics teaching assistant at

* [Lycée Chaptal](https://www.ac-paris.fr/serail/jcms/s2_1584175/fr/accueil) - 2016-2017 - first year class - Prof. Jean-François Lacarra
* [Institut Bossuet](https://www.institutbossuet.fr/) - 2017-2019 - second year students at [Louis-le-grand](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand), [Henri IV](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Henri-IV), [Saint Louis](https://lycee-saintlouis.fr/).
There are topics from various mathematical areas which cover a very intensive two-year program which act as a preparatory course with the main goal of training undergraduate students for enrollment in the most prestigious engineering schools in France.
